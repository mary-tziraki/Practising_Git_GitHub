# Learning and practising Git and GitHub

In this repository I want to demonstrate how to work with version control using git on your local machine and how you can link it with a GitHub remote repository.


1) What is [**Version Control**](./files/version_control_with_git.md) how git is used.
2) The basic [**Unix commands**](./files/The_Unix_Commands.md), frequently used in the command line.
3) The [**Git Commands**](./files/git_command_line.md), frequently used 4) [**Set your SSH Keys**](./files/set_SSH_keys.md) 
5) [**How to connect with GitHub**](./files/Connect_git_local_with_GitHub.md)
6) [**Workflow for Team Coders**](./files/Workflow.md)



In the end, we could have fun and  practice together the interaction of git and GitHub by writing [**recipes**](./files/Recipes.md). 



Please send me your GitHub account to add you as collaborator.

Hope we all have fun being happy  Team Coders 👨🏻‍💻👩‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨‍💻and team cooks 👩‍🍳🧑🏼‍🍳👨🏽‍🍳👩🏻‍🍳

Happy Coding !!
